This is a flooding risk.\n\n⚠️ **Street Light Installation** — Ward 4 - East\n- Assigned to Lakshmi Devi\n- Deadline: March 10, 2026 (approaching)\n- Progress: 40%\n- **Recommendation:** Check if additional resources are needed to meet deadline.`,

Only 1 active task currently.\n\n📊 **Amit Sharma** — 12 completed, Avg 8 days\n- Solid output. 3 active tasks is manageable.\n\n⚠️ **Suresh Reddy** — 9 completed, Avg 12 days\n- Slowest completion time. Had 1 rejection (Health Camp). May need closer oversight.\n\n⚠️ **Rajiv Singh** — 15 completed, Avg 9 days\n- Good track record but Drainage task at 0% is concerning.`,
